I am planning on moving to Germany and I want to express my interest in any Software Engineering and Data Science positions you have for people early on in their careers. The particular city does not matter much, but I have spent some time in Leipzig while attending Univerität Leipzig's interDaF A2 course. I do plan on continuing on to improve my German. I currently do not have a visa to work in the EU, but I was born with dual citizenship to Germany and have been assured that gaining my status back will not be difficult.

I have been working for Booz Allen Hamilton as a Data Scientist with Computer Science specializtion since January 2016 and it has been great. I've worked with several APIs like Apache Nifi, Hadoop, Solr, and Mongo, that would make me a valuable member of your team. I am always willing to learn what is needed to get the job done and do it as efficently as we can.

I love to write code in my free time and I just started putting together a mini-cluster of Raspberry Pis to run a prime number generator program I came up with. I would of course follow any policies put in place by Trivago, but I'm always thinking of how to get my current task completed; even when I'm not physically at work. I've worked rough drafts of code to at home, because I didn't want to lose the idea while I wasn't at work. I would love to bring that kind of drive to Trivago and to ask the questions of the data:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=3em]
\item What can we learn about our customers?
\item What are their habits?
\item What are the factors that seem to bring them back to the site?
\item What categories can we put people in?
\item What can we say about individual users?
\end{enumerate}
